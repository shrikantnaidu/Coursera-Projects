# Gold & Silver Price Prediction using ARIMA
 
About this Course
In this one hour long project, we will build an AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) time series machine learning model to forecast the price of Gold & Silver 30 days into the future. We will start this 1-hour long project by importing all the necessary libraries. We will then download real-time data from Yahoo Finance & visualize the historical performance of Gold & Silver through graphs using Matplotlib. We will dive in-depth into the concept of ARIMA and why it is a really efficient time series algorithm. We will then create an Arima model and forecast the price 30 days into the future.  We will then train, test and evaluate the performance of the model. By the end of this project, you will be confident in analyzing, visualizing and forecasting the price of any commodity or stock of your choice using the ARIMA algorithm.
